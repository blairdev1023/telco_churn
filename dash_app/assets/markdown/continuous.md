### Continuous Variables

There are three continuous variables to explore: Monthly Charges, Total Charges, and Tenure. To examine a single distribution look at the left display. This chart plots the selected feature as either a Histogram or with a Kernel Density Estimation. Tenure is heavily skewed so the 1/20th view will be helpful when looking into that. The chart to the right shows Charges over Tenure as a bar plot. You can toggle the difference and adjust the number of bars.
