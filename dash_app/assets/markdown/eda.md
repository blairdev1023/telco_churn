Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of performing initial investigations on a dataset so as to discover patterns, spot anomalies, and check assumptions. We'll be trying to quantify how Churn customers differentiate themselves. Out of the 21 features for each customer, one is an ID, three are continuous variables, and the rest are categorical variables. Out of those categoricals one is a label of whether or not they churned. So for each customer we have 16 categorical and 3 continuous variables of which we can use to describe why they churn. First we'll investigate the categorical features, then the continuous variables, and then end our EDA by looking at correlation.
