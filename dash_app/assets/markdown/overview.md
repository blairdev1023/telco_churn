This case study focuses on on creating a customer retention program for a fictitious company - Telco. The data used here is a public dataset that can be downloaded from  [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). There are ~7,000 rows of customer data along with a label of whether or not the customer left the company's service in the past month. Leaving the service is typically referred to as _Churn_ - the event we are trying to minimize. Examples of data available on each customer are gender, billings, and tech support usage.

Each section below is devoted to answering one of these three questions:

1) Who typically churns? What are their customer behavior's like?
2) Can we model the clientele such that we can automatically differentiate churn with a _reasonable_ amount of accuracy?
3) Using our best model, what fraction of churn customers can we retain? How will costs associated with that retention affect profitability?
