#### Categorical
The polar plot above reveals some low-hanging fruit about churning customers' behavior.

* They tend to be on a Month-to-Month contract
* Engage less with protecting their device, backing up data, and online security
* Participate _a little bit_ more in streaming services

For some reason choosing paperless billing is popular with those who churn as well. I have no idea why this is as I'd expect the _opposite_. Perhaps there's something about the way they sign up (Month-to-Month vs. Yearly) or additional services that tend to solicit the option more often.

Another curious outlier is that of paying via electronic checking. Retained customers are evenly divided among the payment options but electronic checking (non-automatic).

#### Continuous
##### Monthly Charges
Monthly Charges has the most things to say about it. In the past month customers who had a package priced between $70-105 churned at a rate of 35-40%. That rate is typically between 15-25% for other price ranges.

##### Tenure


##### Monthly Charges over Tenure
Meanwhile the billing over Tenure tells a more interesting story. Typically, the longer someone stays with Telco the more they pay per month. But the customers churning pay an average of $20-25 more than the retained customers _in their Tenure bracket_.

#### Correlation
Tenure vs 2yr, 1yr, MtM: 0.55, 0.20, -0.64

Can't figure out what's up with paperless billing

Streaming movies and streaming TV somewhat correlated .53

Total Charges and Tenure 0.82

Total Charges and Monthly Charges 0.65

Monthly Charge and Internet Service 0.76

Total Charges and Contract MtM - 0.44

Online security, Backup, Protection, and Tech Support lowly correlated against Churn: -0.17, -16, -.15, -.16. Weird, a greater proportion of Retained customers had Tech Support than Churned customers. I'd expect tech support to lead to more churn (having problems) but apparently those who interact with it tend to stay? Maybe churn customers have a technical problem that they don't get help with and that leads to some churn.
